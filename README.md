# Fictional Quote Generator with LangChain and GPT-3.5

This project is a fictional quote generator that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model and LangChain to produce quotes based on a given topic. The model is fine-tuned to generate quotes in a style that matches the examples provided, making it a versatile tool for creative writing, brainstorming, or just for fun.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `langchain_openai` for interfacing with GPT-3.5
- `dotenv` for loading environment variables
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fictional-quote-generator.git
   cd fictional-quote-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install langchain_openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Set up your `.env` file:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script to start generating quotes:

   ```bash
   python generate_quote.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - The script loads environment variables using `dotenv` to keep sensitive information like API keys secure.

2. **Model Initialization:**
   - The GPT-3.5 model is initialized using `langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`.

3. **Example-Based Prompting:**
   - The script uses a `FewShotPromptTemplate` to define the style of the generated quotes. Several example quotes are provided to the model as a reference for generating new quotes.

4. **Quote Generation:**
   - The user is prompted to input a topic, and the model generates a quote based on the examples and the provided topic.

## Example Usage

After running the script, you'll be prompted to enter a topic:

```plaintext
What topic would you like to create a fictional quote for?
```

If you enter "flowers", the model might respond with:

```plaintext
The earth laughs in flowers. - Ralph Waldo Emerson
```

## Features

- **Customizable Templates:** Easily modify the example quotes and templates to suit different styles or themes.
- **Dynamic Quote Generation:** Generate unique and contextually relevant quotes on any topic.
- **User Interaction:** The script interacts with the user to input topics and generate corresponding quotes.

## Possible Improvements

1. **Enhanced Quote Styling:**
   - Experiment with different example quotes to influence the style and tone of the generated quotes.

2. **Web Interface:**
   - Develop a web-based interface using Flask or FastAPI for easier access and usability.

3. **Memory and Context Handling:**
   - Implement a memory feature where the model remembers previous topics or quotes generated during a session.

4. **Multiple Models:**
   - Incorporate multiple LLMs for varied responses and styles, allowing users to choose their preferred model.

5. **Advanced Customization:**
   - Allow users to specify additional parameters such as tone, length, and target audience for more tailored quote generation.
